# Welcome to the oxD Documentation

# Introduction

oxd is a mediator: it provides API's that can be called by a web application that are easier
than directly calling the API's of an OpenID Connect provider. oxd is not a proxy--in some 
cases oxd returns URL's for the OP to which the web application must redirect the user. In addition 
to simplifying the interface, oxd externalizes the OpenID Connect client code. This is particularly useful
because it enables updates to the OpenID Connect and UMA client code, while keeping
the application interface the same.
